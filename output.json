We do not control or interfere with\n                any professional service provided by the Pharmacy, which is solely responsible for its provision of\n                professional services rendered via the Service. By using the Service, you are establishing a direct\n                customer relationship with the Pharmacy, including the purchase of any prescription or non-prescription\n                products sold directly to you by the Pharmacy via the Service.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c0\">Reimbursement</span></p>\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">D2D is not enrolled with, and is not a participating provider with, any federal\n                or state healthcare programs (Medicare, Medicaid, e.g.), nor with any commercial health insurers (Cigna,\n                Aetna, e.g.) for the provision of any health care or supplies and, as such, neither you nor D2D may\n                receive payment from such programs for the services or products provided to you by or through D2D or\n                Pharmacy. Further, to the extent that the Pharmacy may be enrolled in federal or state healthcare\n                programs, the means through which the services and products are provided or made accessible through the\n                Service typically precludes such services and products from being covered benefits under these programs\n                and health insurance policies. By choosing to use the Service, you are specifically choosing to obtain\n                products and services on a cash basis outside of any federal or state healthcare program or health\n                insurance policy. Thus, you are solely responsible for the costs of any service or product provided to\n                you through the Service.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">By agreeing to use the Service, you acknowledge and agree that (1) you are\n                explicitly choosing to obtain products and services on a cash basis outside of any federal or state\n                healthcare program or health insurance policy and you have sole financial responsibility for all\n                services or products provided to you by or through the Service, and (2) neither you nor D2D nor the\n                Pharmacy will submit a claim for reimbursement to any federal or state healthcare program or health\n                insurance company for the costs of the services and products provided to you through the Service.</span>\n</p>\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c0\">Prescription Products</span></p>\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">Certain products available through the Service require a valid prescription by a\n                licensed healthcare provider affiliated with the Service (a &ldquo;Provider&rdquo;). You will not be\n                able to obtain a prescription product unless you have completed a consultation with one of the\n                Providers, the Provider has determined the prescription product is appropriate for you, and the Provider\n                has written you a prescription.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">If a Provider determines a prescription product is appropriate for you and writes\n                a prescription, you will receive information about your options for filling the prescription.

Arbitration uses a neutral\n                arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. An\n                arbitrator, however, can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award\n                to an individual.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">Payment of arbitration costs will be governed by the AAA&rsquo;s fee schedule,\n                unless you are able to show that your portion will be prohibitive as compared to litigation costs, in\n                which case the applicable D2D Party will pay as much of your arbitration costs as the arbitrator deems\n                necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to litigation costs. D2D\n                also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all\n                arbitration costs imposed by the AAA. Each party agrees to pay its own attorneys&rsquo; fees and\n                expenses unless there is a governing statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid\n                attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the D2D Parties will not\n                seek to recover attorneys&rsquo; fees or costs incurred in arbitration from you if you are a\n                consumer.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">The arbitration shall be conducted in Fairfax, Virginia unless the parties agree\n                otherwise in writing.

Our current system is reasonably secure and confidentiality-protective of the\n                information transmitted. &nbsp;It is widely accepted for telemedicine use and provides more privacy and\n                security protection for telemedicine services than do many other alternatives. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">No electronic communication is entirely safe from intruders.

We take measures to protect your privacy, such as encrypting your data,\n                employing password protected screen savers and data files, and utilizing other reliable authentication\n                techniques. These features reduce the risk of a data breach, but do not eliminate them. You can help\n                reduce the risk further. You may be overheard by anyone near you if you are not in a private area during\n                a telemedicine session. &nbsp;It is your responsibility to create an environment at your location for\n                each telemedicine transmission, email, or SMS message that is private and protective of your personal\n                information and communications with us. &nbsp;It is your responsibility to inform us if anyone else can\n                see or hear any part of the session.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">As part of its commitment to privacy, D2D does not record telemedicine sessions\n                without the knowledge and consent of the patient.

We\n                may use telemedicine to diagnose your problems (that is, to figure out what they are), to recommend\n                therapy, medications, or other indicated treatments, to schedule appointments, or to educate you. On the\n                other hand, not every medical problem can be managed at a distance, nor should every medical problem\n                that can be managed at a distance be treated with medication. Your Provider will determine whether your\n                condition is appropriate for diagnosis or treatment through a telemedicine encounter and, if so, what\n                the proper way to manage it is. Depending on the nature of your problem, it may be necessary for you to\n                follow-up with other health care professionals besides your Provider. If so, your Provider will discuss\n                that and possible options with you.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">You or your personal representative can withhold or withdraw consent to receive\n                healthcare services through telemedicine, or seek a second opinion, at any time. &nbsp;Doing so will not\n                affect your right to receive future care or treatment. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">All pertinent confidentiality protections under federal and state law, including\n                but not limited to HIPAA, apply to a telemedicine consultation. </span></p>\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">You or your personal representative can access all medical information resulting\n                from a telemedicine consultation on request as provided under federal and state law governing access to\n                patient medical records. When you obtain your records, it is your responsibility to maintain their\n                confidentiality when in your custody and to arrange for their secure transmission to other providers as\n                needed. To the extent clinically appropriate, you may participate in treatment decisions and in the\n                development and periodic review and revision (updating) of your treatment plan. We will make fee\n                information available to you on request.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">No patient-identifying information from a telemedicine consultation will be\n                provided to researchers or other entities without the written consent of you or of your personal\n                representative. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">The advantages of telemedicine include the ability to be treated from almost any\n                location within your state, and at almost any time during D2D&rsquo;s regular hours. Telemedicine may\n                also enhance the continuity of your care, but it does not always do so, especially if for any reason\n                records of your telemedicine sessions do not get to your primary care physician.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">D2D maintains patient records electronically. As a result, with the cooperation\n                of your previous providers, it is usually possible for us to obtain your old records securely and to\n                maintain them safely. &nbsp;It is almost always possible for us to retrieve your old records at our\n                practice very quickly. &nbsp;Sometimes, however, previous providers may comply with requests slowly, or\n                not at all. Software problems could delay or impede retrieval of even D2D&rsquo;s own records. There is\n                some risk, then, although only a small one, that information valuable or even necessary for your\n                diagnosis will be unavailable, temporarily, or even permanently. If so, your risk of an erroneous\n                diagnosis, and therefore of erroneous treatment, would increase. For example, without old records from\n                previous providers, it may not be possible to tell that a particular medicine is the wrong choice for\n                you, and you might be harmed by taking a medicine we recommend via telemedicine. Of course, risks such\n                as these also exist with in-person care; in our experience reliance on telemedicine neither increases\n                nor decreases these risks. We are aware of these limitations and take them into account in making\n                clinical decisions about your care. Where necessary, we refer patients to in-person care. The risk of\n                error nevertheless exists.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">The physical examination that your Provider can perform through telemedicine is\n                limited. In particular, information that can be obtained only by physically touching you will not be\n                available. Fortunately, touching the patient is generally less important in dermatology than in many\n                other specialties, but to the extent that diagnosis depends on such exams, it may be less accurate that\n                would be the case were it possible for your Provider to touch you. </span></p>\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">In some cases, applicable law may prevent us from providing the services you\n                desire. Should that be the case, we will refer you to another provider.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">Telemedicine is still a relatively new approach to care. It is possible that\n                risks not yet identified or understood may emerge as telemedicine is more widely used.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">WE DO NOT PROVIDE EMERGENCY CARE. If you think you are facing an emergency, or\n                that you might be facing an emergency, please do not rely on us for help. Immediately call 911 or go to\n                your nearest emergency room. &nbsp;D2D does not provide any after-hours care or crisis management\n                services, either. Again, for these services, please call 911 or go to your nearest emergency\n                room.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">For telemedicine sessions, please be available for us to call you by\n                videoconference at the time your session is scheduled. &nbsp;Please connect to your videoconference link\n                promptly at or before the time scheduled for your session. You will be placed into a virtual waiting\n                room until your Provider arrives, at which time you will be admitted to the virtual meeting room.\n                &nbsp;Sessions started late due to your late arrival will be truncated to fit the remaining time\n                available. &nbsp; If you are not available within fifteen (15) minutes after your scheduled time, your\n                session may be rescheduled, and you may be considered a &ldquo;no-show&rdquo; and billed according to\n                our office policies and procedures, available here. &nbsp;When you connect to the virtual meeting room\n                for your session, please be in a private place where you feel comfortable talking about your personal\n                and confidential information.</span></p>\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">Telemedicine relies on electronic communications and devices. These can fail at\n                any time. Any technical failure or power outage could therefore delay or disrupt communication and\n                hinder, delay, or end our ability to assist you with telemedicine. Ordinarily, however, the technology\n                works well. Barring technology failure, we do not anticipate having telemedicine sessions by phone.\n                &nbsp;There may be times, however, when we need to contact you by phone. &nbsp;If you have a cell phone\n                or other wireless or mobile phone, be advised that such phones are not absolutely secure and the privacy\n                and security of information transmitted may be compromised. If you choose to contact us using a cell\n                phone or other wireless or mobile phone, you agree to accept the risk to the privacy and confidentiality\n                of your information that the use of such phones may pose. &nbsp; </span></p>\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">Your Provider is licensed in your state. You must be physically located within\n                your state at the time of your sessions in order to receive clinical care from your Provider.

I understand that D2D offers telemedical services to its\n                patients and that telemedicine, or distance care, is a form of health care that relies on an interactive\n                audio-video interface that allows a patient in one location to see, speak with, and consult a provider\n                in another.
